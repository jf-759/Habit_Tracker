Hello! 

Welcome to Momentum!

Have you ever struggled with keeping a consistent lifestyle? 

Have you ever felt overwhelmed at the manythings you have to do or don't remember what they were or where to start?

Have you wanted to build habits, only to forget them halfway through the week?

Tracking habits can feel overwhelming, but that's where **Momentum** comes in.

Momentum is the project I decided to create based off of my New Year's Goals. It is a simple habit-tracking program built into Python to help users stay consistent with their habits by tracking progress, building streaks, and dynamically managing habits to keep your momentum going. 

**Key features include:**
- Simple habit tracking through the command-line interface (CLI).
- Progress tracking to celebrate small wins.
- Streak-building to keep you motivated..

You can check these [Slides] and the notes within them to explore the project's features and learn about my future plan. Currently, Momentum is CLI-based, but I aim to expand it by:

- Developing a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Add analytics.
- Adding mobile notifications for seamless habit tracking.

Thank you for taking the tim to explore Momentum! It's a simple yet powerful tool to help you stay consistent and acheive your goals. I hope you find it as useful as I've envisioned!
