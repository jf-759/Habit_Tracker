Hello! 

Welcome to Momentum!

Have you ever struggled with keeping a consistent lifestyle? 

Have you ever felt overwhelmed at the manythings you have to do or don't remember what they were or where to start?

Have you wanted to build habits, only to forget them halfway through the week?

Tracking habits can feel overwhelming, but that's where Momentum comes in.

Momentum is the project I decided to create based off of New Year's Goals. It is a simple habit-tracking program built into Python to help users stay consistent with their habits by tracking progress, building streaks, and dynamically managing habits to keep your momentum going. 

If you take a look at these [Slides], you can see a few examples in features of this project, and what I eventually hope to do next. As of right now, this project is only for CLI, however I hope to eventually create a GUI for this, and one day gently integrate it into mobile notifications.

That is all for now, I hope you enjoy this simple, but effective project!
